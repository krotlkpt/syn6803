# _Synechocystis_ sp. PCC 6803

This repository contains the files for the genome scale reconstruction of _Synechocystis_ sp. PCC 6803: iRH783. It is based on the genome [BA000022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BA000022).

## Files

The repository contains the following files:
1. Synechocystis_6803.xml - The SBML of the reconstruction.
2. Synechocystis_6803.yml - A YAML version of the reconstruction.
3. Synechocystis\_6803_constrained.xml - A constrained version of the same reconstruction. The medium is constrained in a way that the only carbon source is CO<sub>2</sub> and the only nitrogen source is NO<sub>3</sub>. Photon uptake is limited to match a growth rate of 1 h<sup>-1</sup>.
4. Synechocystis\_6803_constrained.yml - The YAML version of the same constrained model.
5. iRH783_memote.html - A MEMOTE report for the constrained version of the model.
